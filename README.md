## Hi, I'm Miska Braun — welcome to my digital home

Feel free to check out in graphical version here [Miska Braun's](https://miskab.github.io/MiskaB/) main site, showcasing my professional journey, interests, and projects along with some pictures.

I´m always interested in connecting with fellow like minded people. Currently exploring possibilities of AI and learning new things.

I’m passionate about empowering environments, with fast, clean & lean, and scalable digital things:
- Automation & infrastructure
- Learning & experimentation
- Remote-first, freedom-oriented mentality
- Yesterday was a good day to start new things




*My current "home" for next few years.*
