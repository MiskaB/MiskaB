## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s always been curious about how things work â€” as a kid I broke things just to understand where does the smoke come from when things break, and now over the years, that curiosity has grown into a career focused on helping people and organizations use technology in smarter, more sustainable, and more human-centered ways. Less breaking things and more building things.

I currently work at Eficode as a Cloud Partner Lead, where I get to collaborate with some of the industryâ€™s leading cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and GitHub. What really drives me, though, is not just the tools, but the people â€” building connections, solving problems together, and working in agile, fast-moving environments where we can try new things and learn constantly and go forward.

Iâ€™m especially interested in how AI and automation can reshape the way we build software, interact with systems, and live our everyday lives. Iâ€™m always keeping an eye out for whatâ€™s next â€” whether itâ€™s a new framework, a platform update, or a shift in how we think about digital sustainability.

This site is a place where Iâ€™ll share things Iâ€™m working on, learning about, or just find interesting â€” with the hope that it helps others or starts a conversation.

If any of this resonates, Iâ€™d love to connect â€” especially with others who care about tech, people, and the future.
